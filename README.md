* The course covers on the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, we will learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.
